other teams, which resulted in the development of new monitoring features and dashboards (e.g. Slack bots or 
Redash Dashboards) and in an improved communication and efficiency in problem-solving. 
- Developed internal tools with R, Bash, PostgreSQL, Clickhouse and Python used to support other teams,
resulting in an increased speed and flexibility to meet customer's requests. 
- Created documentation covering the statistical concepts and logic used in our products, which resulted in the 
improved understanding of our products, both internally and by other teams.
