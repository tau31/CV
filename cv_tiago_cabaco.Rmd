<!-- ### About me
I hold a Master degree in Psychology and I develop Statistical Software using R, SQL, Python and Bash.

I enjoy the challenges of processing and exploring complex data, and I use statistics to 
uncover findings and insights.

I welcome the collaboration with colleagues and I am very driven to adjust to each audience when communicating
findings and results.

Being able to dive deep into new topics and learn new technologies, is something that is very dear to me. 

I am looking for an opportunity where I can use my skills to make a real difference in people's life and in our society.  -->
